# Objective PHP / Showcase

## Project topic

This project provides a "fully" functionnal application based on Objective PHP Framework. It mainly contains components demos.

This is the place to start until we provide an actual documentation.

## How to make it work

A few simple steps are needed to get this application up and running:

```
git clone https://github.com/objective-php/showcase
cd showcase
# the next step assumes that composer is available in your PATH
composer install
php -S 0.0.0.0:8001 -t public 
```

You can then open http://localhost:8001 to access live demo of Objective PHP Framework.
